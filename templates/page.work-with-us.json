We curate fashion, homeware, and apothecary that is both soulful and purposeful and has a story to tell. A good story. Like the brands we partner with, we hope to inspire our community to buy less, to buy more conscientiously and to invest in a more sustainable & ethical way forward. To us, style and responsibility can and should co-exist. At The Union Project, they do. <\/p><p>We recognise that we don’t have all the answers, but we aim to curate brands who are on the same journey as us and who share the same intention to empower more informed choices. We are and have always been rooted in community, the union of people, beliefs and protecting the things we love. <\/p><p>We take pride in being an inclusive, dynamic and enthusiastic team who share a set of core values. Delivering the highest levels of customer service is at the forefront of everything we do. <\/p><p>Founded in Cheltenham, we are tightly engrained in our local community and focus on developing close knit bonds with our customers.
