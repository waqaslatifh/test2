Pest epidemics, drought and torrential rain can wipe out an entire year’s work in a matter of days! This acute fear is often what stops conventional farmers from transitioning. <br><br>The risk can be reduced, however. <br><br>The Texas Organic Cotton Marketing Cooperative is an example of a tight-knit collective of growers acting as a support mechanism against the infrequent disasters farmers face. Not only do they offset the cost of disaster, but they also rally together ensuring consistently high prices.<br><br>Similarly, rural producers need support - just in a slightly different way. <br><br>The transition to organic cotton is not without its up-front costs. The risk of getting the organic set-up wrong can be detrimental to entire farming communities.<br><br>There is far more knowledge and skill required in organic methods. Much of this expertise needs to come from external NGOs, to ensure the transition is smooth. <br><br>For example, intercropping and crop rotation are not easy to implement; determining proper products for the area, which are able to market, make an increase on farmers’ income and conveying information to the farmers requires specialist input. <br><br>Just like any other global industry, organic cotton prices differ considerably from region to region. <br><br>Turkey, once the largest producer of organic cotton, has been priced out of organic cotton. The production cost of $1.04kg is less than the selling price of $0.60kg. This requires government assistance in the form of subsidies to support Turkey in maintaining organic production.<br><br>This surprising lack of institutional support and investment in organic cotton is witnessed all over the world, even the US government lack the necessary intervention. When agricultural debt soars and environmental pressure is higher than ever, what better time to invest in organic cotton facilities.</span></p><div data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-evcjhq RvYYJ pf-200_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1204/9844/t/31/assets/global-organic-cotton-production-2020--the-union-project-1647439350636_1200x.png?v=1647439351" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1204/9844/t/31/assets/global-organic-cotton-production-2020--the-union-project-1647439350636.png?v=1647439351 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, (min-width: 1024px) 1280px, (min-width: 640px) 768px, 320px" loading="lazy"/></div><h2 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-ctqQKy ioCblW pf-201_ custom-font"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jtXEFf kGfXVs pf-203_">What Should I Look Out For?&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="sc-fmBCVi laenLa pf-204_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jtXEFf kGfXVs pf-206_">After reading this far (well done, I may add), you should be pretty sold on the idea that organic cotton is a wardrobe must.<br><br>Remember, just like BCI cotton, there are various accreditations that detract us from hearing more about the special qualities of organic cotton through promoting schemes that are more aligned to conventional practices. <br><br>There is also a stark difference between organic cotton and farm-to-finish organic cotton.<br><br>Bottom line: if you’re purchasing organic, you want to know that it’s the real deal! <br><br>What’s the point in brandishing the term ‘organic’ if the dyes used are synthetic and the stitching is made from conventional cotton?
